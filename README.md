# Huffman-Coding-Assembly
Huffman coding algorithm implemented in assembly language

Application first asks you what text file you want to convert.
After initialization, program implements huffman's algorithm, and finds the appropriate codes for all ocuring letters based on frequency of their occurance.
Output of the application is ist of all occuring letters and their responding codes.
